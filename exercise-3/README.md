# Exercise-2

As described in [chapter-5](https://info201-s17.github.io/book/introduction-to-git-and-github.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

The `cp` command can be used to copy a file or folder. For example:

>cp my-photo.png my-photo2.png

Here's some more information about the cp command:

+ It can be used to recursively copy a directory with the `-R` option:
  + cp `-R` folder-1 folder-2
+ You can print out progress to the terminal using the `-v` command, making it verbose):
  + cp `-R` `-v` folder-1 folder-2

See `complete` branch for answers.
