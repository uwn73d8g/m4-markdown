# Exercise-1

As described in [chapter-5](https://info201-s17.github.io/book/introduction-to-git-and-github.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

Then, in the space below, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote. When you push your changes back up to GitHub, you will see the rendered markdown file.

See `complete` branch for an example.

"If you would convince a man that he does wrong, do right. But do not care to convince him. Men will believe what they see. Let them see."
